## Modules ##
# Reusability is an important part of coding
# There are situations where we might opt to resuse a particular code rather
#       than develooping something from scratch ... enter modules
# 
# Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions.
#   These are the pre-written codes that are written by someone else
#   which you can directly use in your code
# 
# We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, 
#   instead of copying their definitions into different programs
# 
#### Types of Modules: ####
#   Built-in Modules
#   Third-Party Modules
#   Custom Modules

# Built In Modules:
#   -are the modules built into python and maintained by the python dev team
#   -to use you can just import them and make the call to the methods you want
#       *EX: Math, Random, Time, Socket etc

# Third-Party Modules:
#   -only different here is we need to install them first (can be installed using pip)
#   - these modules are uploaded and stored at PyPI repo. The Python Package Index,
#           is the official software repo for Python
#       *Install CMD: 
#           windows - pip install module_name
#           mac/linux - pip3 install module_name

# Custom Modules:
#   -created by the dev(me) for reuse of code (need to service modules)
