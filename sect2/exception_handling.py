## EXCEPTION HANDLING ##
# As a user enters inforamtion to a db and say they leave a spot blank
#   this could arise DB Errors and possibly stop the program
#   Exception handling is the process of handling these errors to avoid that situtation
# Error Types:
#   Syntax Err - error in the source code of a program/also called compilion errors
#   Logic Err - undesirable actions caused by inproper logic in code
#   Runtime Err - means program complied correctly but when running leads 
#           to abnormal behavior or terminate the program
# Runtime Errors are generates when the program is runnning and lead to abnormal
#   behavoir or termination of the program -- such are called EXCEPIONS
# 
# Examples:
#   division by zero
#   accessing a file that does not exist
#   addition of two incompatible types
#   trying to access a nonexistent index of a sequence
#   removing the table fro the disconnected database server
# 
# Exception handling allows you ro separate error-handling from normal code
# an exception is a python object which represents and error
# allows you to simulate consequenses as the error handling takes place
#   in onw place and in one manner
# an exception is a convenient method for handling err messages
