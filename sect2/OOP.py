## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) ##

# In the subject "Getting Started" we defined Python
#   as a general-purpose, high-level, object-oriented
#   programming language...
# 
# OOP:
# In programming, there are different paradigms or 
#   patterns that define how to write and structure our code.
#   Also, each paradigm has different functionalicties and behaviors
# EX of vairous programming patterns:
#   Structural programming
#   Procedural Programming
#   OOP
#   Functional Programming
#   etc
# 
# OOP is a programming paradigm that provides a means 
#   for structuring programs so that properties and behaviors
#   are bundled into individual objects
# In the initial subjects, we have seen that the type() method
#   in Python return the type of object i.e the data type of 
#   variable

#   EX: 
# name = "John"
# print(type(name))

# Here focus on the word, 'class'. The variable 'name' belongs 
#   to something called <class 'string'>
# 
# Classes and Objects:
# OOP is a programming paradigm that provides a means for structuring
#   programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into 
#   individual objects
# We can say the object of the class 'string' at the most basic lvl
# OOPs in Python is a programming approach that focuses on using 
#   objects and classes as the building blocks of the programs
# It allows devs to develop apps using OOPs approach with a major focus
#   on code reusablility
# In simple words OOP is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world
#   thing, and relations between those things
# OOP models real-world entities as programming objects that have 
#   some data associated with them and can perform certain functions
