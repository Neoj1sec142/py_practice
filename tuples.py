# TUPLES
##################################
# Similar to lists tuples allow is to store multiple values in a single variable
# Lists = mutable(able to be changed) Tuples = immutable(not able to change-Read Only)
#   tuples are odered collections o multiple values
#   are immutable, and are read only not changable or manipulateable
#   also allow us to store duplicate values
# Tuple = () List = []
# can have any number of items and can be different types(int,float,str)
# tup1 = ()
# tup2 = (1,4,6,3,9)
# tup3 = ("John", 23,56.3,True)
# print(tup3) #= ('John', 23, 56.3, True)
